## Why is it super slow to connect to the Curtin Linux Server via VMware Horizon Client?

> I tried using VMware horizon web client (browser) and also the client app (desktop client) to connect to Curtin Linux Server. But it is super slow and laggy. Any suggestions? Im currently a offshore student.

This may be due to trying to access the Linux server from an offshore location. There are several factors (connection speed, stability of the connection, firewalls, etc) that affect your learning experience with the VMware horizon server. Try to connect to the server in non-peak hours (probably after 10PM at night or early morning in Perth's time). If it continues to be the same please refer to the following link to see what alternatives are there to proceed.

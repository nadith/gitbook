# Collaborate Ultra / Echo360

## Are the videos on echo360 the same as the ones in Collaborate ultra?

No. Echo 360 platform will have the "Practical Supplementary Videos" that you will need to refer to before the practical session. This will help you to complete pre-labs (+ some of the practical questions) before attending the practical session.\
CollaUltra will have other recordings such as "online practical session" + lecture.

## Is there a way to watch the CollabUltra recordings in 2x speed?

Unfortunately, according to the collab-ultra help page:\
[Recordings | Blackboard Help](https://help.blackboard.com/Collaborate/Ultra/Participant/Recordings?utm\_source=Ultra\&utm\_medium=Collaborate\&utm\_campaign=Product\_link\&utm\_content=Participant#captions)\
There is no such option. But you can manually skip using keyboard shortcuts. \
Therefore, as an alternative method, you can download the video recording (from CollabUltra) to your PC and use your media player with 2x speed to playback.

You can download the collab-ultra videos via its web interface (refer to the link above), or alternatively,  you can download it by viewing the source and then use VLC player.

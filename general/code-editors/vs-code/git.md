# Git

Git a source code version control tool. This is very useful for tracking the changes in your code. In case you delete some code lines by mistake, git will show you the deleted lines as well as newly added lines comparing the previous well-known working version of your code.

### Install `Git Graph` Extension in VSCode

### Execute the following commands in the integrated terminal in VSCode

* `git init .`  (initialize git repo)
* `git config --global user.name "<your name>"` (set git global info, mandatory before any commits)
* `git config --global user.email "<your email>"` (set git global info, mandatory before any commits)
* `git log` (very useful command to see the branch history)

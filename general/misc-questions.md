# Misc Questions

## I'm struggling to keep up with UCP. Can I get help?

First of all make use of all the materials (lecture, practical, prac supplementary videos, wiki, glossary, this FAQ, external resource links provided in learning modules in Blackboard) that are made available to you. In case you are unable to find answers, use the discussion board as the last resort. Alternatively, if you need some help to boost your learning, you can attend the senior tutor sessions for UCP. Contact UCP staff for more details. Please be sure not to wait till the last moment since it would be difficult for us to help you out if you have missed out a lot. It is always the best to make use of senior tutoring as soon as the "Pointers" lecture is covered without waiting for too long.

Also, it is highly recommended to watch the Videos in the section below to learn the C concepts interactively with examples.

## I have missed a practical session. Can I attend another?

You are always encouraged and it is highly recommended to get your pracs covered during the week by attending one of the other practical sessions in non-peak hours (8-10AM or after 4PM) provided that you miss your regular practical session. Please refer to "Unit Information" on the Blackboard for more details and pick a one in non-peak hours. Alternatively, you can attend the online practical session or refer to the recording (in collab-ultra) as well.

## How can I report an issue/bug/typo in the code or explanation provided in the FAQ?

If you are certain that there is a bug/typo in one of the sections in the FAQ, please contact us asap during a tutorial/lecture session or online tutorial session. Please refer to the "Unit Information" section on the blackboard to grab details of the sessions.

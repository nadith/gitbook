# Docker, Jupyter and Wiki

## Where are the Wiki Pages? Why some are missing

In the transition phase of moving the wiki from HTML pages to Jupyter notebooks. Therefore, please bear with us if you see some pages are missing at the moment.&#x20;

## Why are the wiki pages published in .ipynb format?

We are in the process of moving the wiki to Jupyter notebooks (extension .ipynb - interactive python notebook) where you can read the concepts in rich text and execute the code snippets on the spot rather than copy-pasting the code snippets to some .c file, compile and run.\
We are using a custom C kernel with Jupyter notebooks to achieve the awesomeness of being able to run C code on the spot avoiding all the hard work you have to go through to run a simple code snippet! :)
